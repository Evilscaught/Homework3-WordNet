/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the data structure(s) you used to store the 
 *  information in synsets.txt. Why did you make this choice?
 *****************************************************************************/
Used a symbol table provided by alg4. I made this choice because I realized that 
words were keys and their ID's are their values.


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the data structure(s) you used to store the 
 *  information in hypernyms.txt. Why did you make this choice?
 *****************************************************************************/
Used a directional graph.  This is because hypernyms.txt represents the relationship
of the words in synsets.txt in an acyclic hierarchical order.  Because of the hierarchical
order I found it necessary to use a digraph. 

/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely the algorithm you use in the constructor of
 *  ShortestCommonAncestor to check if the digraph is a rooted DAG.
 *  What is the order of growth of the worst-case running times of
 *  your algorithms as a function of the number of vertices V and the
 *  number of edges E in the digraph?
 *****************************************************************************/

Description:
I've decided to use the class DirectedCycle (provided in the alg4 library) to
determine if the graph is acyclic. 


Order of growth of running time:


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely your algorithm to compute the shortest common
 *  ancestor in ShortestCommonAncestor. For each method, what is the order of
 *  growth of the worst-case running time as a function of the number of
 *  vertices V and the number of edges E in the digraph? For each method,
 *  what is the order of growth of the best-case running time?
 *
 *  If you use hashing, you should assume the uniform hashing assumption
 *  so that put() and get() take constant time.
 *
 *  Be careful! If you use a BreadthFirstDirectedPaths object, don't
 *  forget to count the time needed to initialize the marked[],
 *  edgeTo[], and distTo[] arrays.
